<h2 id="summary-of-qualifications">Introduction</h2>

<p>My name is Ryan and I am a lead software engineer with over 20 years of experience designing, developing, and maintaining software for a wide range of needs, from startups to small businesses to international corporations.</p
<p>I specialize in listening, learning and communication. My goal with any position is to become a subject matter expert in the systems, the processes, and the people, and use that information to develop software that satisfies the needs of the customers and collaborate with my peers.</p>
<p>I have a never ending desire to grow, both learning new technologies and skills and expanding my business experience. I have been fortunate to work with many great companies and people over the years and I always look forward to bringing my experience to new challenges. I am adept and efficient at learning - I have experience in a variety of languages and paradigms. I always relish the opportunity to learn a new one given the opportunity.</p>
<p>I have experience with large systems, supporting and nurturing legacy applications while designing how they can live and grow into the future, or be carefully transitioned or replaced to better fit the current business needs. I also have experience with startups and greenfield development, moving fast, building the foundations to support a growing business - whether it is an iterative product or one that you need to last for the next decade. I love to focus on developer tooling and abstractions, supporting the developer experience and helping everyone ship faster. </p>
<p>I always aim to be a force multiplier. I want to be a conduit for information within a product team as well as a liaison between product and the rest of the business. One way I achieve that by being an avid note taker and focusing on written communication.</p>
<p>One of my other focuses is on data. I love data analysis and exploring and unearthing data to the business as a whole, providing information for decision making, discovering opportunities and providing evidence to support or disprove hypotheses.</p>



<h2 id="technical-profile">Technical Profile</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Broad relational database experience with many engines including PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MYSQL, DB2 on AS/400 and more. I have years of experience designing databases for both OLTP and OLAP needs.</li>
	<li>Well over a decade of experience with JavaScript, more recently TypeScript, both on the server and client side. I also have experience in several other languages, including mainstream but also more niche languages.</li>
	<li>Server administration experience with Linux and Windows, both on-premises and in the cloud using AWS, Digital Ocean and Heroku.</li>

<h3 id="servicemaster-inc-trugreen-chemlawn-memphis-tn">ServiceMaster, Inc. / TruGreen ChemLawn (Memphis, TN)</h3>

<p><em>Lead Programmer Analyst, June 2005 - July 2009</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TruGreen ChemLawn is a lawn treatment company that provided services to remove weeds and promote healthy grass growth. As lead application developer, I worked primarily on internal applications for critical business functions and efficiency improvements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was involved in many parts of the IT organization at TruGreen, building web applications giving easier access to data and systems from around the country, data analysis, integrating between web applications and mainframe technologies.</p>

<ul>
<li>I designed and developed a project management application to communicate requests, approvals, resources, events, documents, related requests, discussions as well as reporting. This application was custom written to suit the specific needs of our IT organization and process, and quickly became the primary communication medium both inside of the IT organization and with the business who was our customer.</li>
<li>I designed and developed a documentation server solution to manage all types of digital files while allowing them to be indexed and searched quickly. It provided a permissions structure that allowed it be used for both sensitive documents as well as communication releases and collaborative documents. It also provided a versioning system which allowed you to access and discuss specific revisions and was utilized by everyone in the company.</li>
<li>I built and maintained various data management applications to allow maintenance of data by distributed users across distributed databases. This included creating web applications that could determine which of the 210 branches a user worked for and connecting to the appropriate remote system and allowing them to update its data. Traditionally all maintenance of this data was done locally through green-screen RPG applications. These applications allowed not only branch users to update their data in a much nicer user interface, but it also opened up the ability for centralized call-centers and corporate users to have access to the same applications and data.</li>
<li>Along with our six sigma organization I designed and developed a customer retention management application which connected to 210 remote mainframes across the country. This application was built to identify and organize customers who had cancelled our service to be contacted. I organized and improved the work flow for end users which greatly improved productivity and customer retention. After the first year, analysis showed that it had already saved the company $1.5M.</li>
<li>I performed data analysis on marketing data sets to identify prospective customers as well as on customer data for customer research and application support and debugging.</li>
</ul>
