<h2 id="summary-of-qualifications">Introduction</h2>

<p>I am an engineering manager / engineer with over 20 years of experience designing, developing, and maintaining software for a wide range of needs, from startups to small businesses to international corporations.</p>
<p>I specialize in listening, learning, and communication. My goal is to become a subject matter expert in the systems, the processes, and the people, using that knowledge to develop software that meets customer needs and fosters collaboration with peers.</p>
<p>I have a never-ending desire to grow, continually learning new technologies and expanding my business experience. I've been fortunate to work with many great companies and people, always looking forward to bringing my experience to new challenges. I am adept at learning new languages and paradigms, always eager to embrace new technologies and opportunities.</p>
<p>I have experience with large systems, supporting and nurturing legacy applications while designing how they can evolve or be carefully transitioned or replaced to better fit current business needs. I also have experience with startups and greenfield development, moving fast and building foundations to support a growing business, whether iterative or build to last for the next decade. I enjoy focusing on developer tooling and abstractions, enhancing the developer experience and helping everyone ship faster. </p>
<p>I aim to be a force multiplier, serving as a conduit for information within a product team and a bridge between stakeholders, product, and engineering. I achieve this by being an avid note taker and focusing on written communication.</p>
<p>One of my key focuses is data. I love data analysis, exploring and unearthing data to provide business insights, support decision-making, discovering opportunities, providing evidence to support or disprove hypotheses, and measuring the effectiveness of my teams in delivering business value.</p>

<h3 id="servicemaster-inc-trugreen-chemlawn-memphis-tn">ServiceMaster, Inc. / TruGreen ChemLawn (Memphis, TN)</h3>

<p><em>Lead Programmer Analyst, June 2005 - July 2009</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TruGreen ChemLawn is a lawn treatment company that provides services to remove weeds and promote healthy grass growth. As lead application developer, I worked primarily on internal applications for critical business functions and efficiency improvements.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was involved in many parts of the IT organization at TruGreen, building web applications giving easier access to data and systems from around the country, data analysis, integrating between web applications and mainframe technologies.</p>

<ul>
<li>I designed and developed a project management application to communicate requests, approvals, resources, events, documents, related requests, discussions as well as reporting. This application was custom written to suit the specific needs of our IT organization and process, and quickly became the primary communication medium both inside of the IT organization and with the business who was our customer.</li>
<li>I designed and developed a documentation server solution to manage all types of digital files while allowing them to be indexed and searched quickly. It provided a permissions structure that allowed it to be used for both sensitive documents as well as communication releases and collaborative documents. It also provided a versioning system which allowed you to access and discuss specific revisions and was utilized by everyone in the company.</li>
<li>I built and maintained various data management applications to allow maintenance of data by distributed users across distributed databases. This included creating web applications that could determine which of the 210 branches a user worked for and connecting to the appropriate remote system and allowing them to update its data. Traditionally all maintenance of this data was done locally through green-screen RPG applications. These applications allowed not only branch users to update their data in a much nicer user interface, but it also opened up the ability for centralized call-centers and corporate users to have access to the same applications and data.</li>
<li>Along with our Six Sigma organization I designed and developed a customer retention management application which connected to 210 remote mainframes across the country. This application was built to identify and organize customers who had canceled our service to be contacted. I organized and improved the work flow for end users which greatly improved productivity and customer retention. After the first year, analysis showed that it had already saved the company $1.5M.</li>
<li>I performed data analysis on marketing data sets to identify prospective customers as well as on customer data for customer research and application support and debugging.</li>
</ul>
