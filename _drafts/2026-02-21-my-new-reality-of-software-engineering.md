# A Career That Suddenly Changed

I have been a software engineer for more than twenty years. Looking back, it's amazing how many things have changed in that time, and how many things have not. But what has happened in the last year, especially the last six months, has created a fundamental shift in how I work, how I think, how much I produce, and really what it even means to be a software engineer.

I was lucky (I think) to have always known that I wanted to write software as a career. I knew I wanted to work with computers from the moment I heard about them, before I ever actually touched one. When I was around six, my parents got me a [VTech PreComputer 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VTech_PreComputer_1000), a simple device that had math and geography quizzes, a very non-standard terrible keyboard, and a single 20-character dot matrix LCD display. But it had a mode where you could write BASIC, and it came with a spiral notebook that gave you a little information about how it worked. Writing line numbers when you could only see a single line at a time was quite the challenge, but I spent hours writing programs in that thing. Worse yet, it did not have any non-volatile storage, so if you turned the power off, your program was gone. That did not stop me from writing programs over and over again, debugging, improving, and just playing with it for hours at a time. I made computer monitors, cases, and keyboards out of cardboard boxes and markers, just to pretend. When I saw my first "real" PC at my dad's work I was hooked. This was the future, and I wanted to be a part of it.

The idea that I could make these things do things was so empowering and enchanting for me. Like actual magic spells that brought my whims to reality. And there was always this intertwined tension between wanting to learn the languages, the patterns, and better, more efficient ways to write the code, and the actual production of the thing I was trying to build so I could show other people how cool it was. Both brought me so much joy.

And it has been that way for my entire career. I have always loved the actual writing of the code, the sound of my hands on the keyboard, the diffs in version control, but more importantly the problem-solving challenge and the problems I was solving for my users and customers. I was making lives easier, bringing joy to other people, or making them and myself money. But it always required me to do all of the work: understanding the problem, challenge, or pain point; coming up with a solution; making that solution a reality; debugging and maintaining existing code; building; testing; iterating; showing it to other people; and getting it into production.

And now we have these LLMs that can help. I was at my current job when ChatGPT was first released. It was such a novelty at first, then we started getting scared that our jobs were over. Then we settled into the reality that while these things were cool, they had major limitations. They hallucinated. They could not keep much information in context. There was no way they were going to be able to handle our hundred-thousand-line codebases. We were thinking about their knowledge cutoffs, figuring out how and if they might be useful, and some of us were imagining a future where they could do so much more, but that was not the current reality and was not near term.

And slowly but surely things improved. We got new models. We got new tools that could use them. When I started at my current job, we had lots of challenges where we needed to do things at a scale that would mean hiring dozens, if not hundreds, of people if we wanted to do it fully and repeatedly. There was no way we could hire that many people, much less manage them. But we started building toward that future, thinking that one day this might be possible.

Then Claude Code came out. We started playing with it, and it was great, but a very different way of working. Sonnet 3 came out, and it was too expensive to spend too much time in, but we used it more and more. More new models came out, we gave them a little more to do, but still I was writing the majority of the code, just using them for parts that were obvious and routine. Then, in the middle of last year, Sonnet 4 came out. The climate started to change. People started saying it could do so much more. I decided to start using it a lot more, letting it write the code maybe 75% of the time. I was still using things like Cursor's tab completion and writing large blocks of code myself, but I slowly gave it more and more. I was working on large-scale systems, some from scratch, some existing. Large, ambitious projects, the kinds of things I love and am really known for. Architecture-level things. And it was handling it all. It could answer my questions, give me ideas, challenge my plans, and then execute on them.

And then, in the last month, Opus 4.6 and then Codex 5.3 came out. My CTO put out a memo to everyone that we should not be writing most of the code anymore, we should be using the agents. They are smart enough, fast enough, thorough enough. Good enough. I had already decided to try and go all in. I was a little relieved when the memo came out - I had been worried someone was going to come talk to me about how much money I was spending!

So now I have not written more than a dozen lines of code by hand in the last month. Codex writes my code, helps me plan, manages git, creates my commits, pushes my PRs, gets second opinions, responds to review comments and addresses them, manages my stories, just about everything, just with my control and guidance. I am shipping more than ever, getting more done than ever, while writing virtually no code to do it. I am talking to an agent like I would talk to a colleague in Slack. I am writing in languages that I am not nearly as fluent in, but it does not matter. I am still shipping quality code that does the job as well as if written by an expert in those languages. It is a whole new world.

# The New Reality

In some ways, this world has changed so fast, and in other ways it happened slowly enough that you could start thinking and planning for it if you were paying attention. I told someone a year ago that before long it will be like we are all engineering managers with full teams of employees. That is really the way I feel now.

But this reality is not evenly distributed. At my job, and in my social feed, we are in a bubble. We are in many ways on the forefront, consuming this like a firehose, jumping from tool to tool and model to model and trying our hardest to learn the new meta as soon as it comes out, and we still cannot keep up. We are pushing it as far as it will go, and there are still gaps and holes, but we can see a future coming where many of those problems are solved.

At the same time, there are many software engineers in the world who are still working like they did last year and the twenty years before, probably very happy to keep doing things that way. I am partially writing this to tell them I believe they will have to confront this new reality because it is coming whether they like it or not. You might be able to last another six months, or a year. In some niche pockets maybe longer. But five years from now the software engineering landscape will look completely different. Expectations of how and what you can produce will completely change.

I do not think everyone has to change overnight, and I do not think every team will move at the same speed. But the direction is hard to ignore. As tools continue to evolve and get cheaper, faster, and more reliable, teams that adopt them well will compound output, and that will gradually reset what "normal" looks like across the industry.

In the past twenty years as a software industry we have learned new tech, new frameworks, and new languages, but fundamentally the things we had to do and the way we had to work stayed mostly the same. This shift is different. This is not just another tool upgrade. This is a phase shift in the job.

In some ways this feels a bit like when source control was a new thing. When Subversion started to become mainstream (yes, I am that old), I remember having debates and having to proselytize why it was a good, necessary way of working, worth learning and adopting. There were many people who resisted at first. Subversion itself was not particularly easy to work with (I know git seems hard sometimes now, but it is considerably easier than source control used to be). Even some people who were struggling with the things source control solved were reticent to learn it. We take it for granted today, but back then making a copy of your code before a change was just the way many of us worked. But of course this is much bigger. After version control, you still did the same things you did before, just maybe with more steps or in a different order. Nothing fundamental about the job changed. This new way of working is much more revolutionary.

"Revolutionary" is an interesting and apt word here. In tech, we usually use that word in completely positive terms. Who does not want a revolutionary new product? But actual revolutions are messy, ugly, sometimes violent. There are winners and losers. There are people very happy with the status quo who will resist as long as they can. In this revolution there will not be good guys and bad guys, or people who are right and people who are wrong. This is not and should not be a holy war. But I do believe this shift is inevitable. I might be wrong about the exact timeline, but I do not think I am wrong about the direction. We need to start mentally preparing ourselves for what comes next. The economics alone will force the shift.

There will also be many new problems, mostly social and around the software engineering process, that we will have to figure out. Things that were the bottlenecks before will not be, and new bottlenecks will crop up. Some examples: when you are working with an LLM that doesn't get tired or frustrated easily, you tend to do more, and are more ambitious about the projects you pick up. Our average PR size has grown, making reviews difficult. We have to try and remember to keep things smaller. The review burden has grown, not just added lines - we are adding new features constantly, but also taking the time to remove the deprecated or legacy stuff we don't need anymore, things that were a burden to take on before. We are pushing much harder on the product team, they used to have more ideas than we had capacity to execute on. Now sometimes they're struggling to keep up. And just the psychological difference between writing code and reading and reviewing code has become much more pronounced. They take different parts of your brain, and honestly you might get tired quicker. The context switching is easier than it was before, but it still takes its toll.

I don't want to give you the wrong impression - LLMs aren't perfect, this new world isn't without consequences; this isn't some new utopia. That is part of what I'm trying to tell you, why I believe it's time to start paying attention if you haven't been. There is going to be a shift in many parts of this job that we've taken for granted so far, and we have to start coming to terms with them. There may be less demand for software engineers in the future. Certainly I am concerned about junior developer positions, and therefore the future software engineers. I believe many businesses are going to be disrupted by these changes. The economics are changing, the expectations of what software is, who can build it, how quickly new features come out are all going to change drastically. I don't personally believe this is the death of SaaS, but it is true that some customers who can't find software that completely fits their needs might choose to build vs buy more often.

It's also important to realize that not everyone is working on the same kinds of things. The devs building frontends and webapps don't have the same needs as the devs building operating systems - and they will not have the same experience with the agents. When you hear someone saying the agents don't work well for them you shouldn't assume that it applies to you the same way.

You may be revolting against this movement because you don't think AI in general or LLMs in software engineering are actually positive for society. You may be concerned about the energy and water use, the way the data centers and graphics cards and model training are consuming the economy. You may be worried that by participating in it you'll be somehow culpable if this isn't the future you want. I understand those viewpoints, and may even agree with you (the real answer is of course nuanced, and outside the scope of this article). If you're a software engineer today though, I just don't think it matters. This is the future, and it is the present. We are here.

Here is a concrete example: [Block laid off 40% of their workforce](https://x.com/jack/status/2027129697092731343?s=46&t=RBfIf0Ai8BV4MgaHEZTW8Q) because "we're already seeing that the intelligence tools we’re creating and using, paired with smaller and flatter teams, are enabling a new way of working which fundamentally changes what it means to build and run a company. And that's accelerating rapidly." These technologies have reached a critical point that we can be certain now they won't go away. I'll include some links to other opinions at the bottom of this post, but I hope I am convincing you that now is the time to invest your time and energy in scaling up on these technologies.

So if I have convinced you, let me give you some guidance on how you might get started.

# My Suggestions for How to Get Started

I want to tell you that it's ok if you haven't tried these things yet, or are still using agents in an IDE or tab completion, that's fine. If you've thought that this stuff is changing too fast and have wanted some dust to settle before investing in it, that's fair. If you already have a full-time job and learning all of this feels like another full-time job, I get it. If you've tried these agents in the past and were disappointed, I understand. But it's time to try again. Things have changed. They're going to continue to change (more on that later), but they're truly good enough to really put to work and a worthwhile investment of your time at this point. If you haven't gotten started with these technologies yet you aren't late - you are right on time.

So if you are curious but still uncomfortable, I think the answer is not "go all in tomorrow" but it's also not "ignore this for a year." The answer is staged adoption. Start with small, low-risk tasks where the blast radius is tiny. Ask the agent to do one contained change. Something that you already know exactly how you would do it. Review the diff. Run tests. See what it got right, what it missed, and where your instructions were vague. Then do it again. When you get more comfortable, push it further, give it a little more. Install Claude Code, or opencode, and start talking to it. I think you'll be surprised.

The biggest unlock for me was moving from ask mode to explicit planning. Before any moderate change, have the agent produce a plan first. Then force it to ask clarifying questions until there is no ambiguity. I often tell it to be relentless about questions, assumptions, and edge cases. You can go one step further and ask a second agent, with no context, to review the plan and challenge it. That extra pass catches surprising gaps.

If you only take one practical step this week, make it this: install [opencode](https://opencode.ai/), launch it in your current project, leave everything as the default, and just talk to it. Put it in plan mode and tell it what you are about to do and see what it thinks. Have it tell you how a subsystem works. Ask it to find a bug. Just start talking to it and be surprised. Then, when you get a little more comfortable, get an OpenAI subscription and switch the model to gpt-5.3-codex and ask it to do the thing you were about to do.

Do not have brand loyalty in any way. Choose tools not produced by a single LLM provider (the main reason I like opencode right now). Don't fall in love and get attached to any one model. Don't dive too deep into integrations with any one software. A better one will come out tomorrow. This is hard in a lot of ways, it feels like you're never going to "catch up" much less get ahead. That's ok. Part of this new reality is being prepared to learn new things all the time. We are _so early_. Things are going to get better, models are going to get better, tooling is going to get better. We are still figuring out what these things can do and how to work with them every day. If you can be part of that research that's awesome, but don't feel like you have to blaze new trails, use these tools for the value you can get out of them and then replace them as soon as something better comes along.

Trust builds from repetition, not from one impressive demo. At first, keep your hand on the wheel for anything that touches external systems: deploys, migrations, production settings, billing surfaces. Over time as results become predictable you can delegate more of the full loop: branch setup, implementation, tests, commits, PR creation, review response, and cleanup. The goal is not blind trust. The goal is reliable delegation with verification.

One mindset shift helped me a lot: judge this workflow by shipping outcomes, not by how much code you personally typed. I still care about code quality and design choices, but I spend less energy on the bookkeeping around changes. That lowers the activation energy for all the little improvements we used to postpone forever. Tech debt gets burned down. Side quests that never seemed worth the overhead actually get done. Use it to be curious - those ideas you've had but it would take too long to write out and try. Create a branch, tell it what you're thinking, and see what happens.

A normal day for me now is usually one core project I am driving end to end, plus several smaller improvements running in parallel that would have sat in the backlog before. While I am iterating quickly on the main thread, an agent can be tightening tests in one area, fixing a flaky edge case in another, and preparing a cleanup PR for a naming inconsistency we have ignored for months. None of those tasks are individually hard. They were just never worth the setup cost before. I have the agents read my logs and find problems or opportunities for improvement. I have it check my understanding of subsystems or database tables and where they are used. I treat it like a coworker who already knows all the answers or knows where to find out faster than me.

I'll give you an example. Recently my main goal at work has been creating a large system building agents to process and make sense of our data. I am spending the majority of my effort on this, more than enough for a full-time job. Along the way I am seeing bugs or opportunities to improve the UI in other systems, so I fire up another session and tell it what I want and let it cook in the background. Later when I get a break I go and check on its progress, look at the changes and try it out, and tell it to iterate or to cut a detailed PR. I'm shipping several of these side quests a week, things I never would have had time for.

The agents will make mistakes. You'll have to be diligent to catch them. Tests and code reviews and actual QA on your part continues to be as important as ever. The agent might write a few thousand lines of code and you'll realize that it's gone off the rails and you'll have to throw it all away and try again. Frequent commits will help. You'll have situations where you weren't specific enough or the agent misunderstands you and it goes and does the wrong thing. You'll tell it to fix a failing unit test and it will delete the unit test ("fixed the glitch" office space style). These are all things you'll have to navigate and get comfortable with and learn how to avoid. But - it's worth it, and it's time to learn these skills.

Whenever I interview for my next job, right after we talk about compensation and benefits, one of my biggest questions will be my inference budget and flexibility of agent tooling. And I expect that my familiarity with agents and LLMs will be one of their biggest questions for me. That question tells me almost everything I need to know. If a company has no clear answer on inference budget, tooling access, or where agents are allowed in the workflow, it usually means they are still treating this as a side experiment. I will want to work where this is an operating model, not a novelty, and where people are actively designing process around it instead of pretending nothing has changed.

You do not have to stop being an engineer to use this model. You still own the problem framing, architecture decisions, constraints, and quality bar. You are still accountable for what ships. You still need to read every line of code it produces. The difference is that execution becomes collaborative and parallel. In practice, that means you can do more at once, if your team can absorb the review load and process throughput that comes with it.

# Mourning the Loss

Think about where you may be on the [five stages of grief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief). Realize that one day you're going to get to acceptance, but that may take time. It is completely normal if you're still on an earlier stage.

If you are a software engineer because you like typing on the keyboard, writing the actual code, and thinking about the control flow of the program through each successive line in a file, this sucks. It does. I certainly think I am one of those people. I have softened my attachment to the actual code over the last decade of working in startups where the usefulness of the thing I write might not last long as we try to find the elusive product market fit, but I have always cared deeply about not just the outcome but also the formatting, organization, and elegance of the code I produced. I tried to leave code better than I found it with every PR. I cared deeply about names, had debates about comments, fought in tabs-vs-spaces holy wars. I had opinions on the aesthetics of files. I am not happy about leaving that behind. I worry that my ability to read and write code will languish over time, and that somehow that will affect my ability to reason about software itself.

But if you care about solving problems and shipping, this might be the best thing that has ever happened. In so many jobs in my career I advocated for spending time on our tech-debt column in the project management system. There were so many things we wanted to do but could not find the time for. There was never enough time, never enough people to get everything done. We needed to ship the new feature, fix the priority bug, and do the next thing. Going back to maintain old code, or make that improvement, was something you only got to do if you were lucky or you snuck it in. We can do those things now. Most of the time those things were not difficult. They did not need a genius to implement. They required time we did not have.

Now you can give your intent and constraints and opinions to an agent that can do those things for you, including a lot of the bookkeeping around the change that used to make it not worth it. How many times have you looked at what would be a change of only a few lines and chosen not to do it because those few lines were actually hours of work when you considered making the story, creating the branch, writing the tests, creating the PR, asking for reviews, iterating on review comments, and deploying it? Those things are materially easier now.

At the end of the day, we are paid for the things we ship. Shipping has to be the goal. It has been great for the past twenty years that I have been paid to do this thing I love because I was shipping value to customers, but it was the value I was paid for, not the symbols I wrote. I will mourn the loss of artisanal hand-written code.

When I am really honest with myself, though, I am happiest when I am productive. That is such a hard word to define, almost an emotion. But when I go to bed at night, I feel best when I feel successful at getting something new out into the world, a desire made into reality. The mechanics of doing that gave me pleasure, but that was never the thing that mattered most. What matters is shipping.

# There Is So Much More to Say

Maybe you are worried about the costs, maybe you want more opinions on which LLMs to use, which tools to use, and just more examples of what you can do with it and how to fit it into your teams and your processes and your day-to-day. I hope to write more about these things soon (reach out on Twitter if you would be interested). Don't believe everything you see on social media about the topic, but do believe some of it. The signal-to-noise ratio is terrible right now, there are lots of voices trying to make money and drive public opinion. Ignore most of them, but when you start to see themes emerge, pay attention.

I'm going to leave you with some tweets and articles from the past couple weeks that I think help make my points. I'd love to hear what you think - if you agree or disagree.
