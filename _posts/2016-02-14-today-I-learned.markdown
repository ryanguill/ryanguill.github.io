I have been considering starting a blog (technically again) for a while now but I couldn't convince myself that I had something worth saying.  But after being inspired by a [few](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) [different](https://til.hashrocket.com/) [people](https://davidwalsh.name/) that even just documenting what you have learned can make useful and worthwhile content.  I don't expect a large audience &mdash; but this is more about me and my journey than anything.  

The subjects for the posts here will be varied; Certainly lots of technical posts about what I am learning at [my new job](http://www.motorsportreg.com/) but I would expect some scientific, social and possibly even the occasional political thought to come by as well.

I have attempted to do this in the past without much luck &mdash;  I hope to stick with it much longer this time and if you are reading this I hope you help encourage me too.  Hopefully something I learn today can be something you can learn with me.
